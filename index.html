              >Balaklava is a settlement on the Crimean Peninsula and part of
              the city of Sevastopol. Balaklava has changed possession several
              times during its history. A settlement at its present location was
              founded under the name of Symbolon (Σύμβολον) by the Ancient
              Greeks, for whom it was an important commercial city.

            <p class="two-columns__paragraph">
              <span class="two-columns__span-accent">Middle Ages: </span>During
              the Middle Ages, it was controlled by the Byzantine Empire and
              then by the Genoese who conquered it in 1365. The Byzantines
              called the town Yamboli and the Genoese named it Cembalo. In 1475,
              Cembalo City was conquered by the Turks and was subsequently
              renamed Balyk-Yuva (Fish's Nest) which then became Balaklava.

                >Crimean war and after:
              </span>
              The town became famous for the Battle of Balaclava during the
              Crimean War thanks to the suicidal Charge of the Light Brigade, a
              British cavalry charge due to a misunderstanding sent up a valley
              strongly held on three sides by the Russians, in which about 250
              men were killed or wounded, and over 400 horses lost, effectively
              reducing the size of the mounted brigade by two thirds and
              destroying some of the finest light cavalry in the world to no
              military purpose. The British poet Alfred, Lord Tennyson
              immortalized the battle in verse in his Charge of the Light
              Brigade. The balaclava, a tight knitted garment covering the whole
              head and neck with holes for the eyes and mouth, also takes its
              name from this settlement, where soldiers first wore them. Also
              numerous towns founded in English-speaking countries in later
              parts of the 19th Century were named "Balaklava". In 1954
              Balaklava, together with the whole Crimea, passed from Russia to
              Ukraine. In 1957 it was formally incorporated into the municipal
              borders of Sevastopol by the Soviet government and lost city
              status. It became part of the independent state of Ukraine in
              1991. Today there are over 50 monuments in the town dedicated to
              the remembrance of military valor in past wars, including the
              Great Patriotic War, the Crimean War and the Russian Civil War.

            The picturesque valley "Zolotaya Balka" stretches over 2,700
            hectares of land in the Balaklava district, at the junction of the
            Crimean mountains, the Black Sea and the boundless steppe. Our
            winery of the same name is also located here. Zolotaya Balka is one
            of the largest wineries in Crimea and Sevastopol, whose history
            begins in 1889, when the first wine cellars were laid in the
            Balaklava Valley by A.Y. Witmer. Today, Zolotaya Balka produces wine
            using the most modern European equipment exclusively from its own
            grapes grown on one of the best terroirs of the Crimea.
